## Future Updates

At the end of the day, the codebase and file structure for this project is not efficient and could be improved upon. I really like the idea of web scraping so I'm ready to tackle this project again with a React based file structure.

In the future, I plan on completely restructuring this project as a full-scale MERN stack application. I feel this project would greatly benefit from a React based front end because there are components that could easily be abstracted away from each other.
